It's been 2 years since I first built my whizzbang style chicken plucker, and we have put about 200 chickens through it. Overall I am really pleased with it. The processing of our chickens has speeded up enormously.

### There are a couple of small issues with the plucker

- The removed feathers tend to build up at the top of the chute, under the finger plate and needs to be cleared from time to time.

- The chickens legs sometimes get trapped between the edge of the disk and the drum.

***

#### Both of these problems are easily remedied

I've made up a hooked tool to clear the feather build up.

and by removing the leg below the thigh before putting the chickens in the plucker they don't get stuck.

#### **This year I did a complete dismantle to check for wear and tear**

I found that, as expected, the finger plate and the base shelf made from OSB3 board is suffering a bit of water penetration. As can be seen in the photo of the finger plate, the edge of the disk is slightly blown. I think this is partly because the paint has been removed when the chickens legs have got stuck.

The damage is only superficial, so I've greased-up and re-assembled the plucker ready for the next batch of chickens.
