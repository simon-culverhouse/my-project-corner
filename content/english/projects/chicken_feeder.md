This is my 3d printed chicken feeder design, it mounts on to standard 100mm PVC pipe and holds up to 5 days of food for my 6 hens.

This is the model that I produced using TinkerCad. The idea is to allow the chickens access to a limited amount of food at one time so as to reduce waste.

The design is available on **[Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/5wBRT8GkG5M "See my design on Tinkercad")**

The print files and settings can be viewed and downloaded on **[Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4576340)**

### Prepare the PVC pipe

Cut a piece of 100mm PVC pipe to the required length, I made mine 60cm long to allow for it to be hung under the hen house.

Insert the pipe into the printed feeder part. Drill pilot holes for the 4 screws and screw in place.

Drill 2 holes at the opposite end to accept the wire or string for hanging the feeder.

This feeder is made to be hung in a place where it is protected from to rain. My chicken house is raised 1.4 meters off the ground, so I can hang the feeder underneath.

Positioning it under the chicken house also has the advantage of deterring wild birds from 'stealing' the chickens food.

### Updated design

After using the chicken feeder with my hens I found that if I filled it with ground grain it worked fine, however if it was used with whole grain it had a tendance to become blocked.

I went back to my **[Tinkercad design](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/5wBRT8GkG5M "See my design on Tinkercad")** and made a few changes

The changes I made to the design were to reduce the height of the internal cone, removal of internal separations and enlarging the grain feed arches.

These modifications have eliminated the blockage problems and the hens are happy.
