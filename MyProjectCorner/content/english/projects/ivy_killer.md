    For the past 15 years I've been fighting a battle against the ivy which grows on building and trees around my property. It seems to re-grow almost fast as I can cut it back.

### My solution to the problem

After getting a 3D printer, and having printed the standard bits and pieces I was looking for some practical applications.

This was one of my first designs, using SketchUp, I came up with this Ivy Killer. The principle is to inject/feed a 'poisonous' substance on a continuous basis into the plant. The goal being to completely destroy the plant down to the roots. So that it never grows back!

### SketchUp Model

A very simple design consisting of a 'syringe' style body with a push on cap.

### 3d Printing

The print takes about an hour and a half, use a brim to stop it falling over.

I've used ABS and PLA for these, ABS is more difficult to print but is more durable.

The design can be found on here on **[Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3925269)**

### Making the saline/vinegar solution

To prepare a concentrated saline solution, add 200g of salt to 500ml of boiling water and boil continuously for 10 mins. Once cool, pour into a storage jar (I use an old coffee jar) and add 100 ml of white vinegar.

### Application

With a pair of secateurs, cut the plant as low down as possible. Drill a 4mm diameter vertical hole 6-8mm deep and insert the ivy killer.

Fill with the pre prepared concentrated saline/vinegar solution and push the cap on.

It may be necessary to refill after a week, I find that refilling once is usually enough to do the job. Leave the 3D printed ivy killer in place for about 2 weeks, best period is during the summer months when the plant is most active.

I've been using this 3D printed ivy killer for the past 6 months. A very simple design which takes about an hour and a half to print, and is very effective in the control of invasive plants like ivy.

A very easy and permanent way to get rid of unwanted plant growth

### Self seeded tree saplings

My neighbour has a mature ash tree which drops its seeds over my property. The saplings pop up everywhere, they grow really quickly and are hard to pull up without digging.

Now I use the ivy killer and it works really well.
