I have made a **[fly trap](3d-printed-storage-jar-fly-trap "see my 3d printed jar fly trap")** for use outside the house, but inside we still rely a lot on the traditional fly paper strips that you hang up. Although not very pretty, they do work well.

Probably the worst thing about them is that you get the occasional sticky dead fly which falls off and sticks to whatever is underneath.

I have one of these above my office desk, and when the sicky dead flies fall off they land on my laptop. Not nice at all.

This prompted me to come up with the idea of 3d printing an attachment to catch the falling flies.

#### **A simple idea**

Using TinkerCad I created a saucer shaped model with a centre hole to accommodate the fly strip tube.

The design can be seen/edited on **[TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/7gaxdkajjif "See design on TinkerCad")**

#### **Printing the sticky fly catcher**

I printed in grey PLA+ at 0.2 resolution with 20% infill.

The print files can be downloaded **[Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4578004 "Visit Thingiverse for the print files")**

### One hung up in the kitchen

This is the first on that I deployed, in the kitchen above the sink area.

This is a popular place for flies, but when the fall off they land on the tea and hand towels. The 'saucer' will hopefully solve that problem.

The photo shows that it works as hoped. No more sticky dead flies falling off on to something else.

There is also an added advantage in that the 'saucer' adds a bit of weight to the fly strip, making it hang better.

If you use fly paper strips this is a must!
