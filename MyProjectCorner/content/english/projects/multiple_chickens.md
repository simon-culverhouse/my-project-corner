I wanted to see how my homemade chicken plucker would cope with processing 2 chickens at a time. I was a bit concerned that the electric motor wouldn't be powerful enough.

But it worked really well as can be seen in the video.

Unfortunately I couldn’t find my **[Arduino temperature/timer]({{< ref "temperature_timer.md" >}})** device, so had guesstimate when the water was hot enough. I think maybe the scalding temperature was a bit low, as the feathers didn’t come out as easily as usual.

I will be doing a larger batch (25) in the next couple of weeks which will give me a chance to see if it is really a better way of plucking.
